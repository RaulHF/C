Functions are an integral part of any programming language. Functions are mostly use to break the code in small parts, so that the user can use a divide and conquer approach.

A function needs to be declared and defined, as other object in the c language. A function declaraction tell the compiler the name, the return type and the parameter that a function takes as inputs. A function definition provides the actual works of the task. It is important to know that a function needs to be declared before it is being call.

Functions can be declare and define locally to the application or the user can include a library in the application where the functions are define.
