A variable in C has the folowing properties:

1) It has a type.
2) It has a value.
3) It has a memory location.

As it has been shown before the c language is a typed language. Consequently, all the variables used by the c language have a type property. This type property reserves a number of bytes in memory. This is done at definition time.

The value that a variable can take is directly related to the variable type. For instance a char takes an ascii character as input an depends on the machine it reserves a number of bytes in memory so that this value is store. 
In addtion variables can be explicitly and implicitly cast. The cast mechanism is when the user can convert a variable type during execustion time for a given operation. For instance the user can cast an int into a float or a double for a given operation. The interpreter can do this casting operation implicitly, however, it is always good practice to do so implicitly within the code.
