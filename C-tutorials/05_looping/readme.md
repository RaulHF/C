In the c language you can use the concept of looping using the following techniques:

1) while loops; a while loop is a block type that will execute as long as the condition is true.

2) for loops; a for loop is a block type that wil execute as long as the contion is true as the while loop. However, the for loop can be coustomised so that the control variable can be changed in every iteration.

3)do while loops; a do while loop is a block that at least is executed once and then it behaves like a while loop.

I will saw an example that uses the three looping techniques.
